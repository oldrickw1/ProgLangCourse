(* This is a comment. This is our first program. *)

(* Create a variable, have that variable hold 34, of type int. x will be a variable of type int. val is a keyword, it means: I am about to create a variable. '=' is part of that syntax on the right side of the '='is an expression. An integer constant is the simplest kind of expression. Semicolon indicates end of statement.  *)
val x = 34;
val y = 17;
(* Save with C-x C-s. This is now a program. This is a sequence of variable bindings. These 2 lines are bindings.
 To run a program, we use the REPL (Read, Eval, Print loop (C-c C-s + return) *)
